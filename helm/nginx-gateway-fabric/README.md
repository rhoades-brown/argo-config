## Introduction

This chart deploys the NGINX Gateway Fabric in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- [Helm 3.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

### Installing the Gateway API resources

> **Note**
>
> The [Gateway API resources](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api) from the standard channel must be
> installed before deploying NGINX Gateway Fabric. If they are already installed in your cluster, please ensure
> they are the correct version as supported by the NGINX Gateway Fabric -
> [see the Technical Specifications](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-gateway-fabric/blob/main/README.md#technical-specifications).

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml
  ```

  If you are running on Kubernetes 1.23 or 1.24, you also need to install the validating webhook. To do so, run:

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/webhook-install.yaml
  ```

> **Important**
>
> The validating webhook is not needed if you are running Kubernetes 1.25+. Validation is done using CEL on the
> CRDs. See the [resource validation doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-gateway-fabric/overview/resource-validation/)
> for more information.

## Installing the Chart

### Installing the Chart from the OCI Registry

To install the latest stable release of NGINX Gateway Fabric in the `nginx-gateway` namespace, run the following command:

```shell
helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
```

`ngf` is the name of the release, and can be changed to any name you want. This name is added as a prefix to the Deployment name.

If the namespace already exists, you can omit the optional `--create-namespace` flag. If you want the latest version from the `main` branch, add `--version 0.0.0-edge` to your install command.

To wait for the Deployment to be ready, you can either add the `--wait` flag to the `helm install` command, or run
the following after installing:

```shell
kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n nginx-gateway deployment/ngf-nginx-gateway-fabric --for=condition=Available
```

### Installing the Chart via Sources

#### Pulling the Chart

```shell
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --untar
cd nginx-gateway-fabric
```

This will pull the latest stable release. To pull the latest version from the `main` branch, specify the
`--version 0.0.0-edge` flag when pulling.

#### Installing the Chart

To install the chart into the `nginx-gateway` namespace, run the following command.

```shell
helm install ngf . --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway
```

`ngf` is the name of the release, and can be changed to any name you want. This name is added as a prefix to the Deployment name.

If the namespace already exists, you can omit the optional `--create-namespace` flag.

To wait for the Deployment to be ready, you can either add the `--wait` flag to the `helm install` command, or run
the following after installing:

```shell
kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n nginx-gateway deployment/ngf-nginx-gateway-fabric --for=condition=Available
```

### Custom installation options

#### Service type

By default, the NGINX Gateway Fabric helm chart deploys a LoadBalancer Service.

To use a NodePort Service instead:

```shell
helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway --set service.type=NodePort
```

To disable the creation of a Service:

```shell
helm install ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric --create-namespace -n nginx-gateway --set service.create=false
```

## Upgrading the Chart

> **Note**
>
> See [below](#configure-delayed-termination-for-zero-downtime-upgrades) for instructions on how to configure delayed
> termination if required for zero downtime upgrades in your environment.

### Upgrading the Gateway Resources

Before you upgrade a release, ensure the Gateway API resources are the correct version as supported by the NGINX
Gateway Fabric - [see the Technical Specifications](../../README.md#technical-specifications).:

To upgrade the Gateway CRDs from [the Gateway API repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api), run:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml
```

If you are running on Kubernetes 1.23 or 1.24, you also need to update the validating webhook. To do so, run:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/webhook-install.yaml
```

If you are running on Kubernetes 1.25 or newer and have the validating webhook installed, you should remove the
webhook. To do so, run:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/webhook-install.yaml
```

### Upgrading the CRDs

Helm does not upgrade the NGINX Gateway Fabric CRDs during a release upgrade. Before you upgrade a release, you
must [pull the chart](#pulling-the-chart) from GitHub and run the following command to upgrade the CRDs:

```shell
kubectl apply -f crds/
```

The following warning is expected and can be ignored:

```text
Warning: kubectl apply should be used on resource created by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply.
```

### Upgrading the Chart from the OCI Registry

To upgrade the release `ngf`, run:

```shell
helm upgrade ngf oci://ghcr.io/nginxinc/charts/nginx-gateway-fabric -n nginx-gateway
```

This will upgrade to the latest stable release. To upgrade to the latest version from the `main` branch, specify
the `--version 0.0.0-edge` flag when upgrading.

### Upgrading the Chart from the Sources

Pull the chart sources as described in [Pulling the Chart](#pulling-the-chart), if not already present. Then, to upgrade
the release `ngf`, run:

```shell
helm upgrade ngf . -n nginx-gateway
```

### Configure Delayed Termination for Zero Downtime Upgrades

To achieve zero downtime upgrades (meaning clients will not see any interruption in traffic while a rolling upgrade is
being performed on NGF), you may need to configure delayed termination on the NGF Pod, depending on your environment.

> **Note**
>
> When proxying Websocket or any long-lived connections, NGINX will not terminate until that connection is closed
> by either the client or the backend. This means that unless all those connections are closed by clients/backends
> before or during an upgrade, NGINX will not terminate, which means Kubernetes will kill NGINX. As a result, the
> clients will see the connections abruptly closed and thus experience downtime.

1. Add `lifecycle` to both the nginx and the nginx-gateway container definition. To do so, update your `values.yaml`
   file to include the following (update the `sleep` values to what is required in your environment):

   ```yaml
    nginxGateway:
    <...>
    lifecycle:
        preStop:
        exec:
            command:
            - /usr/bin/gateway
            - sleep
            - --duration=40s # This flag is optional, the default is 30s

    nginx:
    <...>
    lifecycle:
        preStop:
        exec:
            command:
            - /bin/sleep
            - "40"
   ```

2. Ensure the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` matches or exceeds the `sleep` value from the `preStopHook` (the default
   is 30). This is to ensure Kubernetes does not terminate the Pod before the `preStopHook` is complete. To do so,
   update your `values.yaml` file to include the following (update the value to what is required in your environment):

   ```yaml
   terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 50
   ```

> **Note**
>
> More information on container lifecycle hooks can be found
> [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks) and a detailed
> description of Pod termination behavior can be found in
> [Termination of Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/Pods/Pod-lifecycle/#Pod-termination).

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the release `ngf`:

```shell
helm uninstall ngf -n nginx-gateway
kubectl delete ns nginx-gateway
kubectl delete crd nginxgateways.gateway.nginx.org
```

These commands remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the release and deletes the release.

### Uninstalling the Gateway Resources

> **Warning: This command will delete all the corresponding custom resources in your cluster across all namespaces!
Please ensure there are no custom resources that you want to keep and there are no other Gateway API implementations
running in the cluster!**

To delete the Gateway API CRDs from [the Gateway API repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api), run:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml
```

If you are running on Kubernetes 1.23 or 1.24, you also need to delete the validating webhook. To do so, run:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/webhook-install.yaml
```
